= What is security ?

== Many definitions
- The protection of data and resources from accidental and
malicious acts, usually by taking appropriate actions
...These acts many be modification, destruction, access,
disclosure or acquisition if not authorized.--ISO/IEC, 1998

- Building Systems to remain dependable in the face of
malice, error or mischance
-- Ross Anderson

== Properties of a secure system (CIA model)
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

=== few more propererties(Not in CIA model)
- Authentication
- Authorzation
- Accountability

== Security violations in practice
- External misuse
- Hardware misuse
- Masquerading
- Setting up subsequent misuse
- Bypassing intended controls
- Active misuse
- Passive misuse
- Inactive misuse
- Indirect misuse

== How to do basic security analysis for a system?
=== System model
- Understand the architecture.
- Enumurate assets and their value.

=== Threat model
- Identify potential attackers.
- Enumurate attackers resource and estimate the number and possibility of attack.

==== Types in threat model
- Attacker action (active or passive) 
- Attacker capability 
- Attacker access (external or internal)

=== Secutiry goals
- Confidentiality (encryption)
- Integrity (cryptographic hashes)
- Authenticity (MAC or keyed hash)
- Availability (DDoS)
- Auditability (Blockchain,          tamper-proof-logs)
- Access control
- Privacy
- Plausible deniability

=== Designing systems
- Security via policy
- Use cryptography and security primitives
- Make your system resilient to attack
- Detection and recovery
